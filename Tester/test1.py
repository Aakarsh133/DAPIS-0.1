#Creating animations in the terminal using Python without external dependencies involves leveraging basic ASCII characters and utilizing loops or timers to create the illusion of motion. Here's an example of a simple animation using Python:



import time
import sys

# Define frames for the animation
frames = [
    "⠋",
    "⠙",
    "⠹",
    "⠸",
    "⠼",
    "⠴",
    "⠦",
    "⠧",
]

# Function to display the animation
def show_animation(frames):
    for frame in frames:
        sys.stdout.write("\r" + frame)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Adjust speed by changing the sleep duration

# Run the animation
for _ in range(20):  # Number of animation cycles
    show_animation(frames)
